<!-- Continuing my Github website build, I have github linked to my vscode. Signed in and have cloned the repository. I'm ready to try and improve the website itself. And create a document "dropbox" within the repository so that people working on their parts can drop documents and I can grab them to add to the website for each of their respective parts. If that makes sense. Can we discuss a layout of the repository or the location of the dropbox, ask any questions about it's structure now if you need. -->
