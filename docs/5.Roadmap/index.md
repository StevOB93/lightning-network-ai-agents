# Roadmap

## Now (stabilize)
- Make Quickstart reproducible on a clean machine
- Ensure start/stop scripts are consistent and documented
- Identify “source of truth” config files

## Next (integrate)
- Formalize A2A message schema used by agents
- Formalize MCP tool schema and tool registry
- Add x402 payment-gated endpoints tied to real Lightning invoices

## Later (evaluate + SoK alignment)
- Define metrics (latency, payment success, tool failure rates)
- Security review: authn/z, replay protection, abuse prevention
- Document findings vs SoK categories
