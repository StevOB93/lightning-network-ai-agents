# Quickstart

This is the fastest path to seeing the system run end-to-end.

## Goal
Bring up the local harness, confirm nodes are reachable, and run an agent workflow.

## Where the runnable code lives
The runnable harness is in: `ln-ai-network/`

## Quick steps (high level)
1. Install prerequisites
2. Boot infrastructure
3. Boot control plane
4. Boot agents
5. Run a smoke test
6. Shut down cleanly

➡️ Follow the detailed run instructions here:
- [Setup → Local Harness (ln-ai-network)](../setup/ln-ai-network/)
- [Runbooks → Start/Stop](../runbooks/start-stop/)
