# config/network.defaults.yml
#
# This file defines network-wide defaults for ALL managed nodes.
# It is the ONLY place where scale is defined.
#
# There must never be per-node configuration files.
# Scaling the network should require changing a single value here.

network:
  # Number of Lightning nodes managed by this system.
  # Increase this number to scale the network.
  managed_nodes: 2

  # Bitcoin network mode.
  # regtest is required for local development and testing.
  bitcoin_network: regtest

paths:
  # Root runtime directory (ephemeral, gitignored)
  runtime: runtime

  # Per-node Lightning data directories
  nodes: runtime/nodes

  # Centralized log storage for all nodes
  logs: runtime/logs

  # RPC socket files for lightning-cli communication

  # Reserved directory for dynamically allocated ports
